\subsection{Individual differences in language processing}

Individual differences in language prediction have become a focal point of recent psycholinguistic research, revealing substantial variability in how people process and anticipate linguistic input. These differences are shaped by a variety of cognitive and linguistic factors, and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of language acquisition and processing \citep{Huettig2016, Li2023, Kidd2018}. In the present two-part study, we probe four areas of individual differences research known to affect prosody perception: working memory, auditory sensitivity, lexical proficiency, and autism spectrum quotient. Specifically, we examine how responses from eight behavioral tasks predict eye-movements during real-time processing and predicting of Italian lexical stress.

\subsubsection{Working memory}
Working memory has been shown to significantly influence anticipatory language processing. \cite{Huettig2016} found that individuals with greater working memory capacity and faster processing speed are better at predicting upcoming linguistic information, as evidenced by their performance in visual world paradigms. Similarly, \cite{Li2023} demonstrated through eye-tracking and ERP studies that working memory plays a crucial role in language prediction and affects how listeners process and anticipate spoken words. Working memory consistently comes up as a meaningful cognitive factor across studies from a variety of languages and serves as a reliable indicator of linguistic processing behavior\citep{mchaney_et_al_2021_workingmemory, goss_2014, hadar_2016}. Here we extend research in this domain to examine whether working memory serves as a reliable predictor of real-time Italian lexical stress prediction and processing.

\subsubsection{Auditory sensitivity}
Reliable detection of auditory spectral and temporal cues is essential for prediction and processing of speech, especially at the prosodic level. Research into auditory processing is broad and interdisciplinary, including work on child L1 acquisition \citep{benasich2002infant}, adult L2 acquisition \citep{lengeris2010effect, kempe2012individual}, and children and adults with language disorders \citep{Liu2018, goswami2013impaired} among other disciplines. 

At the prosodic level, tone languages (which use fundamental frequency for lexical contrasts) pose challenges for listeners with congenital amusia (tone deafness) as they struggle more in word discrimination and identification for tonally contrastive words than their neurotypical peers \citep{nan_2010, zhu2023tone}. These findings indicate that deficits in pitch perception extend to the processing of lexical tones, highlighting the shared processing mechanisms for general pitch cues and linguistic pitch cues. For pitch-accent languages like Japanese, similar findings are reported. \cite{goss_2014} explored the relationship between acoustic pitch sensitivity and working memory in Japanese pitch accent perception, finding that both higher working memory capacity and greater pitch sensitivity significantly enhance pitch accent perception. For individuals with aphasia, impaired processing of risetimes and phoneme identification significantly impacts higher-level language processing in speech comprehension \citep{Kries2023}. Similar results are supported by correlations between risetime detection and syllable level phonological skills, suggesting the importance of sensitivity to amplitude in word recognition \citep{Hamalaine2005}. Moreover, auditory sensitivity to cues can affect both the L1 and L2. For an extreme example, \cite{cutler2007dutch}'s suggests that Dutch speakers are better at English stress than English native speakers, which is corroborated in \cite{Pajak2014} who found that experience with an acoustic cue in one language transfers to a new language gradiently. To the best of our knowledge, there is no experimental work that has examined how auditory sensitivity to pitch, duration, risetime, and amplitude are associated with Italian stress perception or prediction. Our exploratory study is the first attempt at better understanding the connection between auditory processing and real-time Italian stress processing. 

\subsubsection{Lexical proficiency}
Lexical proficiency, both in the L1 and L2, contributes to individual differences in language processing and prediction \citep{Diependaele2013, Yap2012}. For example, \citep{Kukona2016} found that real-time prediction and inhibition are modulated by their proficiency and literacy in both languages. Theoretically, the more proficient a speaker is, the larger their lexicon will be, which in turn results in a larger competitor space as more lexical candidates are activated. Interestingly, bilinguals co-activate both languages during the process of word recognition \citep{kroll1997lexical, dijkstra2002architecture, marian2003competing}, which suggests that if someone has experience with more than one language this may either positively or negatively affect L1 language word recognition. One study of note is \cite{primativo2013bilingual} which found that English-Italian bilinguals' vocabulary size influences speed and reading accuracy of Italian words, particularly accuracy of the stress assignment. Although the present study is concerned with perception (rather than production), \cite{primativo2013bilingual}'s findings suggest there may be a link between the size of the lexicon and sensitivity to subtle prosodic variations. We extend work in this domain to examine whether L1 (and L2) lexical knowledge predicts Italian stress prediction and processing.

\subsubsection{Autism spectrum quotient}
Finally, we examine autism spectrum quotient (AQ: \cite{Baron-Cohen2001}). Research on prosody perception by individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder is a growing sub-field \citep[see ][]{Grice2023, Paul2005, McCann2003}. For example, the demands of word recognition for pitch-sensitive words have been suggested to cause difficulty for those with autism spectrum disorder \citep{schelinski2020speech}. In contrast, \cite{grossman2023relationship} found that the so-called disadvantageous for pitch sensitivity for those with autism are actually modulated by more general cognitive factors and that stress sensitivity was similar to neurotypical participants. Moreover, the literature on auditory sensitivity for those with autism spectrum disorder is mixed, suggesting varied sensitivity to sound \citep{Kuiper2019, Stiegler2010}. We add to this growing body of work and explore whether variability in Italian stress perception may, in part, be accounted for by autism spectrum quotient (AQ). 

To summarize, we carry out an exploratory individual differences study that examines how working memory, sensitivity to pitch, duration, risetime, and formants, lexical proficiency in an L1 and L2, and autism spectrum quotient predict the real-time processing and prediction of spoken Italian tri-syllabic words with differing stress patterns.

\subsection{Spoken word recognition and lexical stress}

Listeners use incoming acoustic-phonetic cues to disambiguate between potential lexical competitors in real-time. For example, when an English speaker hears \textipa{/mE/}, they will activate both \textit{metal} and \textit{melon} among other potential candidates \citep{Marslen1980}. As the second syllable unfolds, listeners will begin to disambiguate the two words. In addition to these cohort competitors, rhyme competitors begin to compete with similar endings words even when onsets differ (e.g., metal and kettle) \citep{Allopenna_1998}. The visual world paradigm, which we use in the present study, offers insight into the time course of word recognition. It is especially valuable in that fine-grained eye movements show early prediction and competition among cohort and rhyme competitors \citep{Allopenna_1998}.

In the present study, we are interested in continuous activation of lexical competitors at the suprasegmental level. For example, Mandarin speakers use tonal information including f0 movement, duration, and amplitude to distinguish between otherwise segmentally identical competitors \citep{Lee2008, Zhang2022}: /m\=a/ and /m\'a/ are segmentally identical but tonally contrastive. Evidence from a classic lexical categorization task \citep{fox_1985} to more recent eye-tracking studies demonstrate the time course of tonal word recognition \citep{zou_2022}. Similar tonal competition effects have been demonstrated in Cantonese \citep{qin_2022, Nixon2016}, while Japanese speakers also make use of f0, duration, and amplitude information in real-time in order to recognize otherwise segmentally identical pitch-accent contrastive words \citep{goss_2014, Cutler1999, Ito2024}.

Lexical tone and pitch-accent, however, are both heavily separable from a word's segmental information; vowels can remain the same while tone categories and pitch-accent patterns change \citep{Zeng2017}. Tones and pitch-accent tend to also be acoustically reliable; the primary cue is f0 height or f0 contour \citep{goss_2014}.  Stress serves as an interesting counter to tone and pitch-accent given just how variable stress can be. The stressed syllable of a word is the syllable that is the 'strongest' \citep{sluijter1996spectral}, but what is perceived as the 'strongest' syllable varies across languages \citep{Cutler1988}. Some languages primarily use duration for stress, while others use pitch or spectral tilt. The reliability of cues across languages also varies from more predictable languages like Spanish to less predictable stress patterns like Catalan and English \citep{ortega_2011, beckman_1994}. That is, for some languages like Spanish, stress can be decoupled from the syllable having little to no effect on the vowel itself \citep{ortega_2011}. However, in languages like English and Italian, this is not possible. Stress changes also directly affect vowel quality, pitch, and/or duration of the syllable. In terms of word recognition, the role of lexical stress is equally complex \citep{cutler2001voornaam, Reinisch2010}

\subsubsection{Italian lexical stress}
Italian listeners are sensitive to lexical stress during word recognition and make use of stress cues before segmentally disambiguating information becomes available \citep{Tagliapietra2005, Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}. Importantly, Italian stressed vowels differ from unstressed vowels in terms of pitch, duration, intensity, and spectral tilt. \citep{Maturi1998}. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} used the visual world paradigm to record eye movements to written tri-syllabic Italian words while spoken Italian words were played (Experiment 1). Although these words can have stress on any of the three syllables, the two most common stress patterns are antepenultimate and penultimate, for example, CAlata vs. caLAmo (capital letters indicate stress). The antepenultimate (first syllable) stress pattern is much less frequent (18\%) than penultimate (second syllable) stress words (roughly 80\% of all Italian tri-syllabic lexicon), but still more frequent than final syllable stress words (2\%) \citep{thornton_1997}. 

\cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} recruited 22 Italian university students (mean age 26.3) and recorded their eye movements as they looked to words shown on screen including a target and competitor that only differed in stress during their first two syllables.  Italian listeners used stress cues during the second syllable, i.e., before segmental disambiguation, to identify the target, thus corroborating previous Dutch research on the time-course of stress integration for word recognition \citep{Reinisch2010}. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} found that amplitude was used by listeners but only when detecting antepenultimate stress (the non-default stress pattern for tri-syllabic words). Importantly, it was the decrease in amplitude from the first vowel to the second vowel of antepenultimate words that listeners made use of. The authors found no difference in looks to antepenultimate and penultimate target words across the syllables. However, once accounting for acoustic cues, it was found that eye-fixations toward the penultimate targets increased for antepenultimate words that lacked the decrease in amplitude. In other words, the authors argued that Italian speakers used their abstract knowledge of lexical stress and considered penultimate stress to be the default but would adjust their predictions in real-time given the (lack of) decrease in amplitude from the first to the second vowel. Finally, the authors also found a significant correlation between looks and spectral tilt during the second syllable. As the difference between spectral tilt from the first vowel to the second vowel decreased, participants looked less to antepenultimate targets. In other words, because antepenultimate words showed a significant difference in spectral tilt from the first vowel to the second vowel (whereas penultimate words did not), participants looked less to antepenultimate stressed words if this difference was reduced or not present. 



\subsection{The current study: Individual differences in predictive eye-movements}
In this study, we embrace both 'daytime science'—the systematic, hypothesis-driven replication of previous findings—and 'nighttime science'—the exploratory investigation into individual differences, rigorously testing established theories while remaining open to new insights, as we replicate the first experiment from \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} and extend it to include an exploratory study into individual differences in Italian stress perception \citep{Yanai2020}. It may be that stress is processed variably across adults as it is in children \citep[e.g.,][]{Colombo2014} and participants with language disorders \citep[e.g.,][]{Cappa1997, Liu2018}. It may also be that \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s relatively homogeneous sample of university students is not representative of behavior found among a larger adult pool of Italian speakers. We add to the relatively small--but growing--body of work looking at individual differences in prosody perception \citep[e.g.,][]{Roy2017, Bishop2017, Lameris2023, Sinagra2022} and explore how individual differences modulate the integration of complex suprasegmental cues for lexical stress in real-time.

We carry out this replication with two goals in mind. First, we believe replications are necessary for the field to progress \citep{Rakosi2017}, and inherently have value \citep{Kobrock2023}. We also believe replicating an in-person eye-tracking study carried out in a university setting with a new population of (non-university student) adults recruited online, using web cameras, is a worthy pursuit \citep{Prystauka_Altmann_Rothman_2023}. We make materials, data, and code available as part of our replication in the interest of promoting open and transparent science. Because we were provided the original audio stimuli from \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, our replication also serves as an opportunity to reanalyze the acoustics and confirm their results, i.e., increase researcher degrees of freedom \cite{Corretta2023}.

Second, we carry out an exploratory study to gain a better understanding of the role of individual differences in prosody perception, particularly what individual difference predictors can help account for real-time lexical stress prediction and processing. While the findings of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} are in themselves worthy of replication, Italian word stress is a relatively understudied area and ripe for a study on individual differences as we do not fully understand how listeners vary in their behavior. \cite{Maturi1998} claim that vowel amplitude serves as the main stress cue (corroborated by \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}) while \cite{Alfano2006} and \cite{Alfano2009} claim vowel duration is the main stress cue while \cite{Tagliapietra2005} claim Italian listeners make use of both vowel duration and intensity to identify the stressed syllable. This variation could be due to the different methods used to test stress perception and/or the different participants tested such that some listeners rely more on one cue while other listeners rely more on another cue, i.e., individual differences in language processing \citep{Yu2019, Kidd2018}.

Here, we aim to first replicate \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s experiment 1 overall group finding with over double the participants tested (\cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}: 22; our replication: 47), using an internet-based recruitment of non-university student adults, and a web-based eye-tracking paradigm \citep{Vos_2017}. We therefore formed the following four research questions for the replication: 1) What are the primary acoustic cues for each stress type? 2) To what extent do antepenultimate and penultimate stress words differ in the time course of word recognition? 3) Is there a bias in target fixations for penultimate stress words due to their higher frequency in the lexicon? 4) To what extent do specific acoustic cues predict recognition of antepenultimate and penultimate stress words? 

In addition to these replication questions, we ask two additional exploratory questions that parallel the second and fourth replication research questions and extend them to individual differences: 1) To what extent do individual differences affect antepenultimate and penultimate stress word recognition? 2) To what extent do individual differences account for specific acoustic cues used during the recognition of antepenultimate and penultimate stress words?

\subsubsection{Predictions guiding our exploratory study}
To better guide our exploratory study, we predict the following results: 

1) Participants with greater working memory capacity will show earlier target predictions during the processing of Italian lexical stress, as their enhanced ability to maintain and manipulate linguistic information facilitates anticipatory processing \citep{Traxler2009, Huettig2016}.

2) Participants with greater auditory sensitivity for any of the four cues (pitch, duration, risetime, formants) will identify prosodic cues more quickly and accurately, leading to faster and more precise predictions of lexical stress. This is due to their ability to use fine-grained acoustic details effectively \citep{nan_2010, goss_2014,mcmurray_2008}.

3) Participants with greater L1 Italian proficiency will look to penultimate targets faster and predict penultimate stress earlier in line with \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} given their greater awareness of the Italian lexicon and its distributional characteristics. Participants with greater L2 English proficiency may look to antepenultimate targets faster and earlier due to this stress pattern's prevalence in English \citep{cutler2007dutch}. However, this proficiency could also cause confusion due to cross-linguistic differences in stress cues, potentially leading to delayed predictions \citep{primativo2013bilingual}. 

4) Participants with higher autism spectrum quotients (AQ) may have greater difficulty with prosody perception, resulting in slower predictions of lexical stress \citep{schelinski2020speech, grossman2023relationship}. Higher AQ scores are expected to correlate with less efficient eye-movement patterns and poorer integration of stress cues during real-time processing.

5) Finally, we expect complex relationships between these individual differences. For instance, heightened pitch sensitivity may offset the negative effects generally associated with higher AQ scores \citep{Liu2018}. Similarly, strong working memory might mitigate difficulties in prosody perception for individuals with lower lexical proficiency \citep{Huettig2016}. To this end, interactions are included in our statistical models and highlight the exploratory nature of our study \cite{Yanai2020}.
