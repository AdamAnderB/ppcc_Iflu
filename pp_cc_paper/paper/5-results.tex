\subsubsection{Acoustic analysis}
Results from our acoustic analysis can be found in Table \ref{tab:acoustics}. P-values have been adjusted for multiple t-test comparisons. As a reminder, we used the same audio stimuli provided by the Sulpizio and McQueen, but we calculated the acoustic measurements using our own scripts and annotations. We found, like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, that all acoustic measures significantly differed between syllables except for spectral tilt in penultimate words. For penultimate words, first syllables were louder (higher amplitude), had a higher pitch (greater f0), and were shorter in duration. For antepenultimate words, first syllables were louder, had a higher pitch, were longer in duration, and had greater spectral tilt. Thus, while our mean acoustic measurements varied somewhat from those reported in the original \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, the overall findings were consistent: amplitude, pitch, duration, and spectral tilt are used by speakers as acoustic cues to convey lexical stress information and there are clear patterns observed given the stress type. See Figure \ref{fig:raw_acoustics} for detailed comparison across words and syllables.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Target and competitor analysis}
Here, we attempt to simplify the modeling approach. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} did six separate mixed-effects analyses, three on each stress type corresponding to three additive time windows. Instead, we use one large model to capture the effects and use stress type as a predictor that could interact with looks over time. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s method of separating the data into antepenultimate and penultimate data before analysis allows one to examine if looks increase independently in both stress types (antepenultimate and penultimate). However, the separation of these analyses makes it impossible to know if there is a difference between fixations during the process of word recognition for the two stress patterns directly. Said another way, syntagmatic and paradigmatic comparison become possible through combining analyses. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} did not find differences in their separate models. In this way, our modeling approach should capture a difference between stress types if there is one. 

Another difference in our analysis is the way that we define time windows of interest. In the original study, there were three time periods for each stress pattern: penultimate (200-396 ms, 200-566 ms, 200-699 ms) and antepenultimate (200-499 ms, 200-566 ms, 200-669 ms). These time windows correspond to the first syllable, first 1.5 syllables, and the second syllable. Like the original study, we have three time windows but our analyses separate these into three discrete time windows over the first two syllables of the word that are not additive: penultimate (200-396 ms, 397-566 ms, 567-699 ms) and antepenultimate (200-499 ms, 500-566 ms, 567-669 ms). That is, we have the first syllable and second syllable as well as a 1.5 window (the average of the first syllable plus half of the second syllable), and the second syllable time window. We did our modeling by starting with a maximal GLMM model defined by predicting binary looks \citep{Barr_2008}. For predictors, we used stress (penultimate-baselines), syllable (syllable 1-baselines), visual stimuli (target, competitor-baseline, a distractor), and their interactions. We used the competitor as baseline to compare looks to targets and distractors so that we could tease apart possible differences between looks in different stress types. The first window is set as baseline. Finally, we gave each participant random intercepts and words random slopes as well as random intercepts.

Model reduction was done by removing the interactions between each respective term and comparing more complex models with simpler models with ANOVA, AIC, and BIC comparison. Through this process, the following model provided the best balance of fit, convergence, and simplicity: $$(fixations \sim stress + visual\ stimuli * syllable + (1|participant)+(1|word))$$  This model had the lowest AIC and BIC values among all models tested, indicating a better fit relative to its complexity. Additionally, ANOVA comparisons between the models demonstrated that the current model was significantly better than simpler models while being sufficiently parsimonious compared to more complex ones. Proportion of looks to targets, competitors, and distractors over the time course of penultimate (top) and antepenultimate (middle) words can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:raw_pen_vs_anti}. Model outputs can be seen at the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:raw_pen_vs_anti}.

Results indicated main effects and their interactions. The distractor had significantly fewer looks as compared to the competitor during the first syllable ($\beta$ = -0.37, \textit{SE} = 0.04, \textit{z} = -10.10, \textit{p} $<$ .001). The competitor had significantly fewer looks during the second syllable as compared to the first syllable  ($\beta$ = -0.13, \textit{SE} = 0.04, \textit{z} = -3.23, \textit{p} $=$ .001). Additionally, an interaction was found between looks to the distractor and syllable 1.5 ($\beta$ = -0.30, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = -4.93, \textit{p} $<$ .001) and again during syllable 2 ($\beta$ = -0.14, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = -2.31, \textit{p} $=$ .02), indicating fewer looks to distractors as compared to competitors during syllables 1.5 and syllable 2. Similarly, an interactions was found between looks to the target and syllable 1.5 ($\beta$ = 0.44, \textit{SE} = 0.05, \textit{z} = 8.20, \textit{p} $<$ .001) and looks to the target and syllable 2 ($\beta$ = 0.58, \textit{SE} = 0.05, \textit{z} = 10.5, \textit{p} $<$ .001) indicating that looks to the target were significantly more probable than to the competitor during syllables 1.5 and even more so in syllable 2.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Target bias analysis}

Following \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, we were interested in examining if there was a bias in target looks as a proportion to the total captured fixations across stress types. To do this, we predicted mean looks to targets with stress as a predictor (baseline - antepenultimate). We included \textit{word} and \textit{participant} as random intercepts as well as random slopes for \textit{word} on \textit{participant} intercepts. The most parsimonious model removed random slopes for \textit{word}. Like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s models, our models found no bias in looks to targets over either stress at any syllable. No significant results were found.   


\subsubsection{Acoustic cue integration}

Finally, we investigated how different acoustic cues influence eye-fixations during word recognition. To do this, we built four mixed-effects models, two for each stress type at syllable 1 and 2, each with identical model structures. For both antepenultimate and penultimate models, target looks were used as the dependent variable with the four scaled measurements of the auditory stimuli (syllable pitch, syllable amplitude, syllable-spectral tilt, and syllable-duration) and all possible two-way interactions as predictors. Additionally, \textit{word} was included as a random intercept. All models started with maximal models and were reduced using a backward stepwise selection procedure. 

The backward stepwise selection procedure began with the full model, which included all main effects and their interactions. Non-significant interactions were removed step-by-step, starting with the highest-order interactions, based on the significance levels obtained from Wald z-tests. Each step involved refitting the model without the least significant interaction or main effect and comparing the fit of the reduced model to the previous model using AIC. The process continued until the removal of any additional terms resulted in a significant increase in AIC, indicating a poorer fit to the data. This method ensures that the final models were parsimonious, retaining only those predictors that contribute significantly to explaining the variance in target looks. While \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} confirmed analyses with reverse regression, their primary analysis focused on correlations between variables and eye-fixations. Our analyses also include interactions between speech cues which may allow us to capture more subtle variations across target fixations for Italian word stress.

For the antepenultimate syllable 1 model, main effects included pitch ($\beta= -0.21$, \textit{SE} = 0.07, \textit{z} = -3.01, $p = 0.003$), which indicates that target words with higher pitch led to fewer looks. Additionally, several two-way interactions were found. An interaction between pitch and amplitude ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.08, \textit{z} = 2.39, $p = 0.02$) indicates more looks to targets with higher pitch and amplitude stimuli. Similarly, an interaction between pitch and duration ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.07, \textit{z} = 2.62, $p = 0.009$) suggests more looks to targets with higher pitch and longer duration. 

In the antepenultimate syllable 2 model, main effects of pitch ($\beta= -2.09$, \textit{SE} = 0.60, \textit{z} = -3.48, $p < 0.001$) and duration ($\beta= -1.25$, \textit{SE} = 0.48, \textit{z} = -2.58, $p = 0.01$) were found, indicating that higher pitch and longer duration led to fewer looks to targets, respectively. When these two cues are combined (higher pitch and longer duration), the effect is still negative ($\beta= -1.60$, \textit{SE} = 0.61, \textit{z} = -2.62, $p = 0.009$), indicating fewer looks to targets.

For the penultimate syllable 1 model, no significant main effects were found. However, an interaction between spectral tilt and pitch ($\beta= -0.26$, \textit{SE} = 0.10, \textit{z} = -2.61, p $=$ 0.009) was found, which suggests fewer looks to targets with higher tilt and pitch. Further, an interaction between pitch and duration ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = 3.13, $p = 0.002$) suggests more looks to targets with higher pitch and longer duration.

For the penultimate syllable 2 model, we found a main effect of amplitude ($\beta= 0.66$, \textit{SE} = 0.21, \textit{z} = 3.13, $p = 0.002$) suggesting that higher amplitude leads to more looks to targets during the second syllable. We also found an effect of duration ($\beta= -0.30$, \textit{SE} = 0.12, \textit{z} = -2.53, $p = 0.01$) suggesting that longer duration leads to fewer looks to targets. Several two-way interactions were also found. An interaction between amplitude and pitch ($\beta= -0.35$, \textit{SE} = 0.14, \textit{z} = -2.50, $p = 0.01$) indicates fewer looks to targets with higher amplitude and pitch. An interaction between amplitude and duration ($\beta= -0.47$, \textit{SE} = 0.16, \textit{z} = -2.96, $p = 0.003$) indicates fewer looks to targets with higher amplitude and longer duration. An interaction between spectral tilt and pitch ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.35, $p = 0.02$) indicates more looks to targets with higher tilt and pitch. An interaction between duration and pitch ($\beta= 0.26$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.99, $p = 0.003$) indicates more looks to targets with longer duration and higher pitch.

\subsection{Replication summary}
We first corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s acoustic results using the same stimuli but different methods. Thus, despite increasing researcher's degree of freedom \citep{Corretta2023}, we found the exact same pattern of acoustic differences between the two stress types (see Table \ref{tab:acoustics}).

Next, in our target-competitor analysis, we corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s findings that looks to the target were greater during the first 1.5 syllables and second syllable across both antepenultimate and penultimate words. Our modeling technique also allowed us to show that distractors---which differed segmentally from the target---were already being considered less during the first syllable (and onward in time). Our combined analysis also provided insights into the time course of word recognition across both stress-types: the competitor was disambiguated primarily during the second syllable as the looks to competitors and distractors became more similar and looks to targets steadily increased across syllable 1.5 and 2.

Next, we did an analysis of target fixations alone to determine if there was a bias toward looks to penultimate words overall given that the majority of tri-syllabic Italian words have penultimate stress. We once again corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}: no bias in looks to targets was found between antepenultimate and penultimate words.

Lastly, we carried out four target analyses involving the four acoustic cues we measured. Unlike \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, we included interactions in our models, which provided more nuanced results. For antepenultimate words during the first syllable, a higher pitch led to fewer target looks. However, a higher pitch combined with higher amplitude or a higher pitch combined with longer duration led to greater target looks. For penultimate words during the first syllable, a higher pitch combined with higher spectral tilt led to fewer target looks while a higher pitch combined with longer duration led to greater target looks. Thus pitch combined with another acoustic cue helped drive eye-movements to the target during the first syllable for both stress types.

For antepenultimate words during the second syllable, a higher pitch once again led to fewer target looks while a longer duration led to fewer target looks. For penultimate words during the second syllable, a higher amplitude led to greater target looks while a longer duration led to fewer target looks. A higher amplitude combined with a higher pitch or a higher amplitude combined with a longer duration led to fewer target looks. A higher pitch combined with higher spectral tilt or a higher pitch combined with a longer duration led to greater target looks. Thus pitch combined with another cue continued to play a role in driving eye-movements to the target during the second syllable for both stress types. Importantly, duration and amplitude also played a role in driving eye-movements during the second syllable. 

\subsection{Extension}

Next, we carry out our exploratory individual differences analysis using eight behavioral tasks: working memory (measured by digit span), the auditory battery tasks (pitch d$'$, duration d$'$, risetime d$'$, formant d$'$), English and Italian language proficiency (measured by the respective LexTALE or LexITA tasks), and autism spectrum quotient (AQ). The primary aim is to identify which of these measures significantly contribute to target looks during word recognition and how they interact with Italian stress patterns over the first two segmentally identical syllable positions. Centered and regularized individual difference measures can be found in Figure \ref{fig:plot_raw_task}.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Centered data across our eight individual difference behavioral tasks}
  \label{fig:plot_raw_task}
\end{figure}


For all our exploratory analyses, we employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression to perform variable selection due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and multi-collinearity \citep{Zhang2020, Tibshirani1996}. Early data exploration revealed high correlations between the four battery tasks, and several moderate correlations between other individual difference measures. LASSO helps resolve this by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. This allows for the identification of the most relevant predictors. Before fitting the models, a LASSO regression was performed to select significant variables. The LASSO model was fit using a $\lambda$ search space. Cross-validation was employed to find the best $\lambda$. The significant predictors and their interactions were identified using LASSO regression, and the resulting variables were used to fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The GLMMs provide detailed insights into how each predictor affects target looks, accounting for random intercepts by word.


\subsubsection{Target and competitor analysis - individual differences}

In the antepenultimate stress model, main effects of English LexTALE ($\beta= 0.29$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 3.20, $p = 0.001$) and duration d$'$ ($\beta= -1.50$, \textit{SE} = 0.37, \textit{z} = -4.01, $p < 0.001$) were found, indicating that increased English proficiency led to more target looks, while lower duration sensitivity led to fewer target looks for antepenultimate words. Interactions between pitch d$'$ and syllable 1 ($\beta= 0.89$, \textit{SE} = 0.21, \textit{z} = -4.29, $p < 0.001$) and pitch d$'$ and syllable 1.5 ($\beta= 0.80$, \textit{SE} = 0.34, \textit{z} = 2.35, $p = 0.02$) were found, indicating increased looks to targets during the first syllable and 1.5 syllable for those with greater pitch sensitivity.

No main effects were found in the penultimate stress model. An interaction between syllable 1.5 and formant d$'$ ($\beta= 0.95$, \textit{SE} = 0.39, \textit{z} = 2.43, $p = 0.02$) was found, suggesting greater looks to targets for those with formant sensitivity early in the word. Additionally, in the second syllable, several interactions were found: syllable 2 and duration d$'$ ($\beta= -1.09$, \textit{SE} = 0.49, \textit{z} = -2.21, $p = 0.03$), syllable 2 and pitch d$'$ ($\beta= -0.65$, \textit{SE} = 0.30, \textit{z} = -2.16, $p = 0.03$), both of which indicate fewer looks to targets for penultimate words during the second syllable for those that have reduced duration and pitch sensitivity. Positive interactions between syllable 2 and formant d$'$ ($\beta= 1.42$, \textit{SE} = 0.46, \textit{z} = -3.13, $p = 0.002$) and syllable 2 and LexITA ($\beta= 0.64$, \textit{SE} = 0.28, \textit{z} = -2.30, $p = 0.02$) were found, indicating greater looks to targets during the second syllable for those with greater formant sensitivity and higher Italian proficiency. 

\subsubsection{Acoustic cue integration - individual differences}

For all models below, the final models are indicated by the existence of a coefficient in Figure \ref{fig:extened_analysis}. Additional model details are available in our R code. In order to distinguish between individual difference measures and acoustic measures, acoustic measures are called by name alone, while individual difference measures will be called by measure followed by the metric (e.g., acoustic pitch of a word will be called \textit{pitch} and the measure of acoustic sensitivity to pitch will be called \textit{pitch d$'$}) 

The parsimonious antepenultimate syllable 1 model revealed a significant positive effect of pitch d$'$ ($\beta$ = 0.90, \textit{SE} = 0.22, \textit{z} = 4.13, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001) and English LexTALE ($\beta$ = 0.26, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.81, \textit{p} $<$ 0.01), indicating that both better pitch sensitivity and higher English proficiency predict more target fixations. The interaction between duration d$'$ and duration ($\beta$ = -1.00, \textit{SE} = 0.38, \textit{z} = -2.63, \textit{p} $=$ 0.009) and the interaction between risetime d$'$ and spectral tilt ($\beta$ = -0.66, \textit{SE} = 0.27, \textit{z} = -2.45, \textit{p} $=$ 0.01) indicate fewer looks to targets for those with better duration discrimination ability for words with longer duration, as well as fewer looks to targets for participants with better risetime discrimination given antepenultimate words with higher spectral tilt.

The parsimonious antepenultimate syllable 2 model revealed a negative interaction between pitch and English LexTALE ($\beta$ = -0.44, \textit{SE} = 0.15, \textit{z} = -3.05, \textit{p} $=$ 0.002), indicating that words with higher pitch lead to fewer target fixations by those with higher English proficiency. 

The parsimonious penultimate syllable 1 model was null. No significant predictors or interactions were found.

The parsimonious penultimate syllable 2 model revealed a negative effect of duration ($\beta$ = -1.08, \textit{SE} = 0.49, \textit{z} = 2.21, \textit{p} $=$ 0.03) and a positive effect of LexITA ($\beta$ = 0.81, \textit{SE} = 0.20, \textit{z} = 4.11, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001) indicating fewer looks to targets for words with longer duration and greater looks to targets by participants with greater Italian proficiency scores. Additionally, a positive interaction between formant d$'$ and duration ($\beta$ = 1.17, \textit{SE} = 0.51, \textit{z} = 2.28, \textit{p} $=$ 0.02) was found, indicating higher target looks for words with longer durations by those with better formant discrimination ability. 


%We also evaluated predictors with a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model and a random forest model. The decision to use k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and random forest models in our analysis is grounded in the need to capture complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, which might not be fully addressed by parametric methods like LASSO regression. A k-NN with 10-fold cross-validation was applied to predict eye-fixations for each word stress on each syllable using acoustic features and individual difference measures. The optimal number of neighbors was determined to be 5, resulting in an overall accuracy of 72.92\% and a $\kappa$ value of 0.66. The random forest model further identified significant predictors, with syllable-duration having a mean decrease accuracy of 113.73 and a mean decrease gini of 1707.49, syllable-pitch having a mean decrease accuracy of 102.53288 and a mean decrease gini of 1851.24, syllable-spectral tilt having a mean decrease accuracy of 95.065 and a mean decrease gini of 1211.03, and syllable-amplitude having a mean decrease accuracy of 70.23 and a mean decrease gini of 1196.16. Additionally, cognitive measures such as the English Lextale (mean decrease accuracy = 63.10, mean decrease gini = 267.91) and working memory (mean decrease accuracy = 84.98, mean decrease gini = 231.02) were important to the model fit. These findings underscore the importance of integrating both acoustic and cognitive predictors to capture the complexity of word stress perception.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Extension summary}

In our exploratory individual differences analysis, we first found that for antepenultimate words, participants with greater pitch sensitivity showed increased target looks in the first syllable and 1.5 syllable. Participants with higher English LexTALE proficiency showed more antepenultimate target looks overall. For penultimate stress words, participants with greater formant sensitivity showed greater looks to targets during the early part of the word (syllable 1.5) and again during syllable 2. Participants with greater Italian LexITA proficiency showed increased target looks in the second syllable. Conversely, participants with weaker duration and pitch sensitivity showed fewer target looks during the second syllable. 

In our cue integration analysis, for penultimate words in the first syllable, neither acoustic cues nor individual differences were significant predictors. In the second syllable of penultimate words, participants with higher Italian proficiency and greater formant sensitivity showed more target looks for words with longer durations in the second syllable. For antepenultimate words, participants with higher pitch sensitivity and greater English proficiency showed more target looks in the first syllable, while those with higher duration sensitivity for longer durations showed fewer target looks. Fewer target looks for words with both higher risetime and spectral tilt was also found. In the second syllable of antepenultimate words, words with higher pitch led to fewer looks, especially for those with higher English proficiency.
