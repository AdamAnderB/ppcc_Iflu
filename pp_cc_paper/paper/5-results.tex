\subsection{Replication}

We first compare the results of our replication study with the results of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s in-person eye-tracking task. We asked four research questions in line with the original study: 1) What are the primary acoustic cues for each stress type? 2) To what extent do penultimate and antepenultimate stress words differ in the time course of word recognition? 3) Is there a bias in target fixations for penultimate stress words due to higher frequency in the lexicon? 4) To what extent do specific acoustic cues predict recognition of penultimate and antepenultimate stress words?  

\subsubsection{Acoustic analysis}
Results from our acoustic analysis can be found in Table \ref{tab:acoustics}. As a reminder, we used the same audio stimuli provided by the Sulpizio and McQueen, but we calculated the acoustic measurements using our own scripts and annotations. We found, like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, that all acoustic measures significantly differed between syllables except for spectral tilt in penultimate words. In penultimate words, first syllables were louder (higher amplitude), had a higher pitch (greater f0), and were shorter in duration. In contrast, for antepenultimate words, first syllables were louder, had a higher pitch, were longer in duration, and had greater spectral tilt. Thus, while our mean acoustic measurements varied somewhat from those reported in the original \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, the overall findings were consistent: amplitude, pitch, duration, and spectral tilt are used by speakers as acoustic cues to convey lexical stress information and there are clear patterns observed given the stress type. See Figure \ref{fig:raw_acoustics} for detailed comparison across words and syllables. The largest and most apparent difference can be seen between syllables across stress types is found in duration (see Figure \ref{fig:raw_acoustics}) with an interaction between first and second syllable and duration length. The difference between amplitude and pitch both go down between syllable 1 and 2 across stress types with antepenultimate words having a greater decrease. Spectral tilt, on average, is higher in both stress types for stressed syllables.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Target and competitor analysis}
Here, we attempt to simplify the modeling approach. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} did six separate mixed-effects analyses, three on each stress type corresponding to three additive time windows. Instead, we use one large model to capture the effects and use stress type as a predictor that could interact with looks over time. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s method of separating the data into penultimate and antepenultimate data before analysis allows one to examine if looks increase independently in both stress types (penultimate and antepenultimate). However, the separation of these analyses makes it impossible to know if there is a difference between fixations during the process of word recognition for the two stress patterns directly. Said another way, syntagmatic and paradigmatic comparison become possible through combining analyses. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} did not find differences in their separate models. In this way, our modeling approach should capture a difference between stress types if there is one. 

Another difference in our analysis is the way that we define time windows of interest. In the original study, there were three time periods for each stress pattern: penultimate (200-396 ms, 200-566 ms, 200-699 ms) and antepenultimate (200-499 ms, 200-566 ms, 200-669 ms). These time windows correspond to the first syllable, first 1.5 syllables, and the second syllable. Like the original study, we have three time windows but our analyses separate these into three discrete time windows over the first two syllables of the word that are not additive: penultimate (200-396 ms, 397-566 ms, 567-699 ms) and antepenultimate (200-499 ms, 500-566 ms, 567-669 ms). That is, we have the first syllable and second syllable as well as a 1.5 window (the average of the first syllable plus half of the second syllable), and the second syllable time window. We did our modeling by starting with a maximal GLMM model defined by predicting binary looks \citep{Barr_2008}. For predictors, we used stress (penultimate-baselines), syllable (syllable 1-baselines), visual stimuli (target, competitor-baseline, a distractor), and their interactions. We used the competitor as baseline to compare looks to targets and distractors so that we could tease apart possible differences between looks in different stress types. The first window is set as baseline. Finally, we gave each participant random intercepts and words random slopes as well as random intercepts.

Model reduction was done by removing the interactions between each respective term and comparing more complex models with simpler models with ANOVA, AIC, and BIC comparison. Through this process, it was found that the parsimonious model (eye-fixations \~ stress + visual stimuli * syllable + (1|participant)+(1|word)) provided the best balance of fit, convergence, and simplicity. This model had the lowest AIC and BIC values among all models tested, indicating a better fit relative to its complexity. Additionally, ANOVA comparisons between the models demonstrated that the current model was significantly better than simpler models while being sufficiently parsimonious compared to more complex ones.

Results from the target-competitor GLMM found significant effects for several main effects and their interactions. In terms of visual stimuli effects, distractor 1 ($\beta$ = -0.37, \textit{SE} = 0.04, \textit{z} = -10.10, \textit{p} $<$ .001) had significant differences from competitor looks overall suggesting fewer looks to distractors during the first syllable. Additionally, a main effect during the second syllable was significantly more likely as compared to the first ($\beta$ = -0.13, \textit{SE} = 0.04, \textit{z} = -3.23, \textit{p} $=$ .001) indicating overall less competitor looks during the second syllable.

Additionally, the interactions between looks to distractor 1 and syllable 1.5 ($\beta$ = -0.30, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = -4.93, \textit{p} $<$ .001) and the interaction between looks to the distractor 1 and syllable 2 ($\beta$ = -0.14, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = -2.31, \textit{p} $=$ .02) indicate less looks to distractors as compared to competitors during syllables 1.5 and syllable 2. The closer to zero beta in the second syllable interaction compared to 1.5 indicates looks are less likely to be dissimilar during second syllable than first between competitors and distractors. This is corroborated by the interactions between looks to the target and syllable 1.5 ($\beta$ = 0.44, \textit{SE} = 0.05, \textit{z} = 8.20, \textit{p} $<$ .001) and looks to the target and syllable 2 ($\beta$ = 0.58, \textit{SE} = 0.05, \textit{z} = 10.5, \textit{p} $<$ .001) indicate that looks to target were significantly more probable than to competitor during syllable 1, 1.5, and even more so in syllable 2. These findings highlight the time course of word recognition over the period of the word. While it would be inappropriate to interpret a NULL effect for stress type, it is worth noting that stress did not come up significant in the models. That is, any additional variance explained by stress and its interactions was found to be unjustified when accounting for added complexity. Proportion of looks to targets, competitors, and distractors over the time course of penultimate (top) and antepenultimate (middle) words can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:raw_pen_vs_anti}. Additionally, model outputs can be seen at the bottom of Figure \ref{fig:raw_pen_vs_anti}.

Model output from the target and competitor analysis can be seen at the bottom of the figure}
  \label{fig:raw_pen_vs_anti}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Target bias analysis}

Due to the distributional bias that is inherent in Italian stress patterns, \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} fit a linear mixed-effects model on proportion of looks to target values only. Similarly, we were interested in examining if there is a bias in target looks as a proportion to the total captured fixations across stress types. To do this, we predicted mean looks to targets with stress (baseline - antepenultimate) to ensure that there was no bias overall in looks by stress type over the word. We additionally used \textit{word} and \textit{participant} as a random intercept as well as random slopes for \textit{word} on \textit{participant} intercepts. Like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}. The Parsimonious model removed random slopes for \textit{word}, and our models found no bias in looks to targets over either stress at any syllable. No significant results were found.   


\subsubsection{Acoustic cue integration}

Next, we investigated how different speech cues influence eye-fixations during the process of word recognition. To do this, we built four mixed-effects models, two for each stress type at syllable 1 and 2. For both penultimate and antepenultimate models, target looks were used as the dependent variable. The cue of the respective syllables was then used to predict looks to target. The model structure for all four of the models is identical. That is, target looks (looking to target-1, not looking to target-0) were predicted by four scaled measurements of the auditory stimuli (syllable pitch, syllable amplitude, syllable-spectral tilt, and syllable-duration) and all possible two-way interactions. Additionally, \textit{word} is used as a random intercept. All models started with maximal models and were reduced using a backward stepwise selection procedure. 

The backward stepwise selection procedure began with the full model, which included all main effects and their interactions. Non-significant interactions were removed step-by-step, starting with the highest-order interactions, based on the significance levels obtained from Wald z-tests. Each step involved refitting the model without the least significant interaction or main effect and comparing the fit of the reduced model to the previous model using AIC. The process continued until the removal of any additional terms resulted in a significant increase in AIC, indicating a poorer fit to the data. This method ensures that the final models are parsimonious, retaining only those predictors that contribute significantly to explaining the variance in target looks. While \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} confirmed analyses with reverse regression, their primary analysis focused on correlations between variables and eye-fixations. Our analyses also include interactions between speech cues which may allow us to capture more subtle variations across target fixations for Italian word stress.

For the penultimate syllable 1 model, like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, no significant main effects were found. However, the interaction between spectral tilt and pitch ($\beta= -0.26$, \textit{SE} = 0.10, \textit{z} = -2.61, p $=$ 0.009) suggests fewer looks to targets with higher tilt and pitch. Further, the interaction between pitch and duration ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.06, \textit{z} = 3.13, $p = 0.002$) suggests more looks to targets with higher pitch and longer duration.

For the penultimate second syllable model, unlike \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, we found a main effect of amplitude ($\beta= 0.66$, \textit{SE} = 0.21, \textit{z} = 3.13, $p = 0.002$) suggests that higher amplitude leads to more looks to targets during the second syllable. We also found an effect of duration ($\beta= -0.30$, \textit{SE} = 0.12, \textit{z} = -2.53, $p = 0.01$) suggests that longer duration leads to fewer looks to targets. Several two-way interactions were also found. The interaction between amplitude and pitch ($\beta= -0.35$, \textit{SE} = 0.14, \textit{z} = -2.50, $p = 0.01$) indicates fewer looks to targets with higher amplitude and pitch. The interaction between tilt and pitch ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.35, $p = 0.02$) indicates more looks to targets with higher tilt and pitch. The interaction between duration and pitch ($\beta= 0.26$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.99, $p = 0.003$) indicates more looks to targets with longer duration and higher pitch. The interaction between amplitude and duration ($\beta= -0.47$, \textit{SE} = 0.16, \textit{z} = -2.96, $p = 0.003$) indicates fewer looks to targets with higher amplitude and longer duration.

For the antepenultimate syllable 1 model, main effects include pitch ($\beta= -0.21$, \textit{SE} = 0.07, \textit{z} = -3.01, $p = 0.003$), which indicates that higher pitch words lead to fewer looks to targets for antepenultimate words. Additionally, several two-way interactions were found. The interaction between pitch and amplitude ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.08, \textit{z} = 2.39, $p = 0.02$) indicates more looks to targets with higher pitch and amplitude stimuli. Similarly, the interaction between pitch and duration ($\beta= 0.20$, \textit{SE} = 0.07, \textit{z} = 2.62, $p = 0.009$) suggests more looks to targets with higher pitch and longer duration. 

In the antepenultimate second syllable model, a main effect of pitch ($\beta= -2.09$, \textit{SE} = 0.60, \textit{z} = -3.48, $p < 0.001$) indicates that higher pitch leads to fewer looks to targets. Similarly, a main effect of duration ($\beta= -1.25$, \textit{SE} = 0.48, \textit{z} = -2.58, $p = 0.01$) suggests that longer duration leads to fewer looks to targets. Lastly, the interaction between pitch and duration ($\beta= -1.60$, \textit{SE} = 0.61, \textit{z} = -2.62, $p = 0.009$) indicates fewer looks to targets with higher pitch and longer duration.

\subsection{Replication summary}
We first corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s acoustic results using the same stimuli but different methods. Thus, despite increasing researcher's degree of freedom \citep{Corretta2023}, we found the exact same pattern of acoustic differences between the two stress types (\ref{tab:acoustics}).

Next, in our target-competitor analysis, we corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s findings that looks to target are greater during the first 1.5 syllables and during second syllable across both the penultimate and antepenultimate words. However, our modeling technique also allowed us to show that distractors were already being considered less during the first syllable, which makes sense because the distractors are segmentally different than competitors and targets. The combined analysis also provides insights into the time course of word recognition across both stress-types, with the negative main effect of syllable two and the interaction betas between distractors and syllable 1.5 and 2 suggesting that the competitor is disambiguated primarily during the second syllable as the looks to competitors and distractors becomes more similar and the looks to targets are steadily increasing across syllable 1.5 and two.

Next, we do an analysis of target fixations alone to determine if there is a bias toward looks to penultimate words overall in the visual stimuli due to the overwhelming amount of penultimate words in the Italian lexicon. No bias in looks to targets was found between penultimate and antepenultimate words(like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}).

Last, we did four target analyses for acoustic cues for the first and second syllables of both penultimate and antepultimate words separately. 
For the penultimate first syllable, we corroborated \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s findings that looks to targets of first syllable for penultimate words are not directly affected by individual speech cues. However, our modeling approach additionally allowed us to explore interactions, which allowed us to explore effects between acoustic cues. Here, we find an interaction between higher pitch and longer duration for more looks to targets, while we found that syllables with higher spectral tilt and pitch had a negative impact on target identification. Unlike \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, the antepenultimate syllable 1 model found pitch to be a primary cue for antepenultimate word recognition. That is, lower pitch overall leads to less looks to target words, while this is offset by higher pitch words that have longer duration or higher amplitude. This finding suggests that antepenultimate words with higher pitch during the first syllable complicate word recognition. This competition is resolved, however, by high pitch syllables that have longer duration or higher amplitude. \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} found higher amplitude to be correlated with more looks during the first syllable for antepenultimate words. Overall, these findings suggest that acoustic cues are indeed used during the first syllable for both penultimate and antepenultimate word recognition. However, the relationship is complex and requires the use of multiple acoustic cues simultaneously as well as interaction between the respective cues for successful word recognition.

Finally, the second syllable models overall show that many acoustic cues are utilized for word recognition in Italian stress competitors. The penultimate model suggests that longer duration during the second syllable leads to less target looks (even though most penultimate second syllables are much longer), while higher amplitude leads to more target looks. This again suggests the importance of amplitude in the process of disambiguating stress minimal pairs in Italian \citep{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}. Additionally, the positive interactions between duration and pitch as well as spectral tilt and pitch, show that higher pitch and longer duration in second syllable penultimate syllables lead to more target fixations, while higher amplitude and duration as well as higher pitch and amplitude leads to less target fixations.

In the antepenultimate model second syllable model, both the main effects of pitch and duration as well as their interactions suggest higher pitch and longer duration lead to less looks to targets. That is, when antepenultimate words have higher pitch and/or longer duration on the second syllable, this confuses participants and they look away from the target word. From the perspective of acoustic cue reliability, shorter duration and lower pitch are the more reliable cues of the second syllable for antepenultimate words, which could be the reason that contradictory acoustic information may be confusing to participants. 

Overall, our findings for our target analyses suggest that penultimate words are primarily recognized using amplitude during the second syllable with an interaction between other cues. In contrast, antepenultimate words are recognized by lower pitch during both first and second syllables. Additionally, duration in the second syllable becomes important for word recognition between stress pairs.

\subsection{Extension}

Next, we carry out our exploratory individual differences analysis. The measures include working memory (measured by digit span), the auditory battery tasks (pitch d', duration d', risetime d', formant d'), English and Italian language proficiency (measured by the respective LexTALE or LexITA tasks), and autism spectrum quotient (AQ). The primary aim is to identify which of these measures significantly contribute to target looks during word recognition and how they interact with Italian stress patterns over the first two segmentally identical syllable positions. Centered and regularized individual difference measures can be found in Figure \ref{fig:plot_raw_task}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{visuals/plot_raw_task.jpeg} % Adjust the width as needed
  \caption{Centered data across 9 individual difference tasks}
  \label{fig:plot_raw_task}
\end{figure}


We employed LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression to perform variable selection due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data and multi-collinearity \citep{Zhang2020, Tibshirani1996}. Early data exploration revealed high correlations between the four battery tasks, and several moderate correlations between other individual difference measures. LASSO helps resolve this by penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients. This allows for the identification of the most relevant predictors. The LASSO regression was applied separately for each stress pattern. The significant predictors and their interactions were identified using LASSO regression, and the resulting variables were used to fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). The GLMMs provide detailed insights into how each predictor affects target looks, accounting for random intercepts by word.


\subsubsection{Target and competitor analysis - individual differences}

Before fitting the models, a LASSO regression was performed to select significant variables. The LASSO model was fit using a $\lambda$ search space. Cross-validation was employed to find the best $\lambda$. Significant variables based on LASSO coefficients were selected and used to construct the formula for the GLMMs.

\textit{Extended penultimate stress analysis}. 

In the penultimate stress model, the parsimonious formula included syllable, English LexTALE, LexITA, and the interactions between syllable and duration d', pitch d' and formants d', LexTALE, LexITA, and AQ. 

Significant findings include no main effects. However, the positive interaction between syllable 1.5 and formant d' ($\beta= -.95$, \textit{SE} = 0.39, \textit{z} = 2.43, $p = 0.02$) suggests greater looks to targets for those with formant sensitivity early in the word. Additionally, in the second syllable several interactions were found. The negative interaction between syllable 2 and duration d' ($\beta= -1.09$, \textit{SE} = 0.49, \textit{z} = -2.21, $p = 0.03$) as well as pitch ($\beta= -.65$, \textit{SE} = 0.30, \textit{z} = -2.16, $p = 0.03$), indicate less looks to targets for penultimate words for those that have less duration and pitch sensitivity during the second syllable. The positive interactions between syllable 2 and formant d' ($\beta= 1.42$, \textit{SE} = 0.46, \textit{z} = -3.13, $p = 0.002$) and LexITA ($\beta= -.64$, \textit{SE} = 0.28, \textit{z} = -2.30, $p = 0.02$) indicate greater looks to targets for those with greater formant sensitivy and high Italian proficiency during the second syllable.

\textit{Extended antepenultimate stress analysis}.

In the antepenultimate stress model, the formula included syllable, duration d', LexTALE, and the interactions between syllabel and duration d' and the interaction between pitch d' and LexTALE scores. 

Significant findings include a positive effect of LexTALE ($\beta= 0.29$, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 3.20, $p = 0.001$) and a negative effect of duration d' ($\beta= -1.50$, \textit{SE} = 0.37, \textit{z} = -4.01, $p < 0.001$) indicating that English proficiency is all positively predictive of more target looks, while lower duration sensitivity is predictive of less target looks for antepenultimate words. Interactions between pitch d' and syllable 1 ($\beta= .89$, \textit{SE} = 0.21, \textit{z} = -4.29, $p < 0.001$) and syllable 1.5 ($\beta= 0.80$, \textit{SE} = 0.34, \textit{z} = 2.35, $p = 0.02$) indicates increasing looks to targets during the first syllable and 1.5 syllable for those with greater pitch sensitivity.

\subsubsection{Cue integration - individual differences}

Like the extended analysis for simple word recognition, for cue integration and individual differences, we use a LASSO regression to select significant variables before fitting GLMMs. In the model selection process for fitting the GLMM, we start with a maximal model with the following predictor variables: working memory, duration d', pitch d', risetime d', formants d', English LexTALE, LextITA, AQ and their interactions with syllable-pitch, syllable-duration, syllable-amplitude, and syllable-spectral tilt. To identify the most relevant predictors, we employ LASSO regression in the same manner as the above analysis. Like the above model, we use the significant variables identified by the LASSO regression, to construct a formula for the GLMM, which includes a random effect for \textit{word}.

For all models below, the final models are indicated by the existence of a coefficient in Figure \ref{fig:extened_analysis} in addition to our descriptions. Additionally, in order to distinguish between individual difference measures and acoustic measures, acoustic measures are called by name alone, while individual difference measures will be called by measure followed by the metric (e.g., acoustic pitch of a word will be called \textit{pitch} and the measure of acoustic sensitivity to pitch will be called \textit{pitch d'}) 

For the penultimate syllable 1 extended model, the parsimonious model included pitch and the interactions between pitch d' and duration, formant d' and pitch, LexTALE and spectral tilt, AQ and spectral tilt, and LexITA and duration. No predictors or interactions had significant effects.

For the antepenultimate syllable 1 model, the formula included duration d', pitch d', LexTALE, LexITA, and the interactions between duration d' and duration, pitch d' and pitch, and risetime d' and pitch, risetime d' and spectral tilt. Significant findings included a positive effect of pitch d' ($\beta$ = 0.90, \textit{SE} = 0.22, \textit{z} = 4.13, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001) and LexTALE (Estimate = 0.26, \textit{SE} = 0.09, \textit{z} = 2.81, \textit{p} $<$ 0.01), indicating that both better pitch sensitivity and higher English proficiency predict more target fixations. The interaction between duration d' and duration ($\beta$ = -1.00, \textit{SE} = 0.38, \textit{z} = -2.63, \textit{p} $=$ 0.009) and the interaction between risetime d' and mean tilt ($\beta$ = -0.66, \textit{SE} = 0.27, \textit{z} = -2.45, \textit{p} $=$ 0.01) indicate fewer looks to target for higher duration discrimination ability for words with longer duration, as well as fewer looks to targets for partiicipants with better risetime discrimination during antepenultimate words with higher spectral tilt during the first syllable.

For the penultimate syllable 2 extended model, variables included duration d', pitch d', formants d', LexTALE, AQ, LexITA, and the interactions between pitch d' and amplitude, risetime d' and pitch, formant d' and duration, LexTALE and pitch. Significant findings include a positive effect of LexTALE ($\beta$ = 0.90, \textit{SE} = 0.38, \textit{z} = 2.40, \textit{p} $<$ 0.05), LexITA ($\beta$ = 8.58, \textit{SE} = 2.49, \textit{z} = 3.45, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001), and a negative interaction between duration d' and syllable-pitch ($\beta$ = -0.77, \textit{SE} = 0.36, \textit{z} = -2.14, \textit{p} $<$ 0.05) indicating that higher English and Italian word knowledge is predictive of more target looks and that higher duration discrimination abilities lead to fewer looks at target stimuli when the syllable-pitch is high. Additionally, the interaction between formants d' and syllable-duration ($\beta$ = 1.02, \textit{SE} = 0.51, \textit{z} = 2.00, \textit{p} $<$ 0.05) indicates higher target looks for those with higher formant discrimination ability for words with longer durations.

Lastly, for the antepenultimate syllable 2 model, the final formula included duration d', LexTALE, pitch d', and their interactions with spectral tilt, pitch, and syllable-amplitude. Significant effects included a negative effect of duration d' ($\beta$ = -2.09, \textit{SE} = 0.53, \textit{z} = -3.95, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001), which indicates high duration sensitivity increases the competition for antepenultimate words in the second syllable. The interaction between LexTALE and syllable-pitch was also significant ($\beta$ = -1.32, \textit{SE} = 0.28, \textit{z} = -4.78, \textit{p} $<$ 0.001) indicating that those with high LexTALE scores had fewer target fixations on items with higher pitch.

We also evaluated predictors with a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model and a random forest model. The decision to use k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and random forest models in our analysis is grounded in the need to capture complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and outcomes, which might not be fully addressed by parametric methods like LASSO regression. A k-NN with 10-fold cross-validation was applied to predict eye-fixations for each word stress on each syllable using acoustic features and individual difference measures. The optimal number of neighbors was determined to be 5, resulting in an overall accuracy of 72.92\% and a $\kappa$ value of 0.66. The random forest model further identified significant predictors, with syllable-duration having a mean decrease accuracy of 113.73 and a mean decrease gini of 1707.49, syllable-pitch having a mean decrease accuracy of 102.53288 and a mean decrease gini of 1851.24, syllable-spectral tilt having a mean decrease accuracy of 95.065 and a mean decrease gini of 1211.03, and syllable-amplitude having a mean decrease accuracy of 70.23 and a mean decrease gini of 1196.16. Additionally, cognitive measures such as the English Lextale (mean decrease accuracy = 63.10, mean decrease gini = 267.91) and working memory (mean decrease accuracy = 84.98, mean decrease gini = 231.02) were important to the model fit. These findings underscore the importance of integrating both acoustic and cognitive predictors to capture the complexity of word stress perception.
