The recruitment of 50 L1 Italian L2 English speakers were managed through Prolific \citep{Palan_2018}. Here, native Italian speaker is defined to mean those that self-identified as Italian dominant, acquired Italian as their first language, and passed an 80\% threshold on an Italian Lextale \citep{Brown_Tusmagambet_Rahming_Tu_DeSalvo_Wiener_2023}. An additional 29 potential participants were rejected due to failing initial calibration requirements (i.e., three removed for low Italian lextale sores, 25 removed for failed headphone-checks \citep{milne_2021} and/or failed web-camera-checks). To ensure data quality and maximize retained participants, three median absolute deviations (MAD) from median square root transformed reaction was calculated as the standard for removal for each task \citep{Leys_2013}. Of the  participants who remained,  were removed for low accuracy scores. Of these, were removed for being below MAD range in the language tasks and  for low performance in the rhythm auditory-motor integration task.  After removal,  participants' (age: mu = , data were retained for analysis.
