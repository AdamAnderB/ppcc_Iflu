\subsection{Participants}
The recruitment of 50 L1 Italian L2 English speakers were managed through Prolific \citep{Palan_2018}. Here, native Italian speaker is defined to mean those that self-identified as Italian dominant, acquired Italian as their first language, and passed an 80\% threshold on an Italian Lextale \citep{Brown_Tusmagambet_Rahming_Tu_DeSalvo_Wiener_2023}. An additional 29 potential participants were rejected due to failing initial calibration requirements (i.e., three removed for low Italian lextale sores, 25 removed for failed headphone-checks \citep{milne_2021} and/or failed web-camera-checks). To ensure data quality and maximize retained participants, three median absolute deviations (MAD) from median square root transformed reaction time was calculated as the standard for removal for each task \citep{Leys_2013}. Of the  participants who remained,  3 were removed for low reaction time and 1 was removed for low accuracy scores. Of these, 3 were removed for being below MAD range in the language tasks and  for low performance in the task.  After removal,  participants' (age: mu = , data were retained for analysis. 

\subsection{Materials}

28 pairs taken from \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} of trisyllabic words were selected as targets and competitors (see Appendix A). The target competitor pairs were each made up of two real words that are segmentally identical for the first two syllables. However, the stress of the two words varied between second (penultimate) and first syllable stress (antipenultimate). For each of these word-pairs, the segments diverged at the third syllable (e.g., Canapa)
