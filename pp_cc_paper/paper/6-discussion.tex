The present study aimed to replicate and extend the findings of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} on the role of lexical stress in word recognition among Italian speakers. Through our replication and extension, we sought to provide a deeper understanding of individual differences in processing Italian lexical stress, utilizing a more heterogeneous sample. Additionally, we aim to explore the relationship between cognitive measures and speech cue integration during Italian word recognition of suprasegmentally contrastive competitors.

\subsection{Replication findings}
Like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, our findings suggest that there is no differences between looks to targets over the time course of word recognition for penultimate or antepenultimate tri-syllabic words. That is, for both stress types, looks to targets increase over the time course of word recognition. One difference between our results and \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} is in which cues are primarily used during Italian stress processing.

\subsubsection{Acoustic metric comparisons}
In contrast to \cite{Corretta2023} findings, measures are all reasonably close between studies with the exception of the scale for spectral tilt being different. However, all measurements are similar and t-tests reveal similar magnitude and identical direction of differences between all comparisons. Due to directionality and magnitude similarities for spectral tilt measure comparisons, the difference in spectral tilt scales is likely due to differences in calculating spectral tilt rather than segmentation differences. The method used in our study comes directly from \citep{sluijter1996spectral,cutler2007dutch}. However, upon examination, the exact manner that spectral tilt is calculated can vary from study to study. Our approach is available on OSF in the text\_grid\_extractor.Rmd. Additionally, the variation between different acoustic cues is not consistent across stress. For example, the largest and most apparent difference in acoustic cues is found in duration (see Figure \ref{fig:raw_acoustics}) with an interaction between first and second syllable and duration length. The difference between amplitude and pitch both go down between syllable 1 and 2 across stress types with antepenultimate words having a greater decrease. Spectral tilt, on average, is higher in both stress types for stressed syllables. That is, acoustically, duration is the most salient and reliable cue to differentiate antepenultimate and penultimate words, followed by pitch, amplitude, and spectral tilt, respectively.


\subsubsection{Target and competitor}

Moreover, we found no significant effect of stress on fixation patterns, aligning with \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s conclusion that stress does not significantly influence word recognition within the tested tri-syllabic Italian words. This consistency strengthens the evidence that, while suprasegmental features like stress are integrated during word recognition, they may not independently alter the fixation dynamics overall across different words for all participants. That is, looks to targets could be averaging out to be similar across both stress types even if differences are occurring\ for words with specific acoustic cue characteristics, which we explore below. 

\subsubsection{Target bias}

The second analysis (bias analysis) did not find differences between stress types for target fixations. That is, participants did not look more toward penultimate words even though they are more common in the Italian lexicon. 

\subsubsection{Cue integration}

Third, in our cue integration analyses of first syllables, like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, we did not find any main effects for acoustic cues in first syllable penultimate word target fixations. However, we did find an interaction between syllable-spectral tilt and syllable-pitch. This may be because words with higher spectral tilt and pitch during the first syllable may be perceived as stressed due to large overlap with antepenultimate stress cues (see Figure \ref{fig:raw_acoustics}). The interaction between pitch and duration, contrastively, leads to more target fixation, which may be due to duration being a primary cue of stress in Italian \cite{Alfano2006}. On the other hand, for the antepenultimate stress words at the first syllable, higher pitch first syllables seem to cause confusion and make participants look away from targets (possibly towards competitors). This could be due to the participants perceiving the higher pitch as stress. This notably contrasts with \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s finding that amplitude is a predictor during the first syllables of antepenultimate words, which we did not find. The interactions between syllable-pitch and syllable-amplitude as well as syllable-pitch and syllable-duration also indicate complex cue integration supporting the use of multiple competing cues simultaneously \citep{Kong2016}.

In terms of second syllables, we found less consistent results with \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}. We found a main effect of amplitude for penultimate second syllables, where they found no significant cues in penultimate words. That is, participants use amplitude in the second syllable to determine if a word has penultimate stress (penultimate words are not the default but rather recognized during the second syllable). For the antepenultimate second syllables, higher pitch and duration lead to less target looks, which suggests that participants are using pitch and duration information in the second syllable to lower competition with penultimate words during word recognition \cite{McMurray2019}. These results together suggest that participants are not only using abstract knowledge that penultimate words are more frequent, but rather using both the first and second syllable stress cue information to determine the identity of a word for both antepenultimate and penultimate words.

\subsection{Individual differences in word recognition}
Extending beyond the replication, our analysis incorporated individual difference measures such as working memory, lexical proficiency (English and Italian), AQ, and sensitivity to speech cues (pitch, formant, duration, and risetime). Our findings underscore the importance of these individual differences in lexical stress processing.

The LASSO regression and GLMM analyses highlighted significant predictors of target looks, particularly Lextale scores and auditory processing skills. For instance, higher English LexTale and LextITA scores were associated with increased looks to targets, indicating that greater lexical proficiency enhances word recognition accuracy. Additionally, the interactions between these cognitive measures and acoustic cues suggest complex, non-linear relationships that influence how listeners integrate stress information during word recognition.


\subsubsection{Target and competitor - individual differences}
First, in the target and competitor individual difference for penultimate words, a formant sensitivity during the first 1.5 syllable and second syllable leads to early target fixations suggesting that vowel quality is a key cue for penultimate word recognition, mirroring vowel quality use in Italian geminate discrimination \cite{Tsukada_Cox_Hajek_Hirata_2017}. During syllable 2, sensitivity to duration and lower pitch decreased looks to targets, meaning that lower pitch second syllables increase competition for Italian listeners. Similarly, for participants with higher duration sensitivity less looks occur in the second syllable, which may be an indication of excessive sensitivity to duration causing more competition. Additionally, higher Italian vocabulary knowledge results in less competition with antepenultimate competitors when hearing a penultimate word suggesting that when a person knows more Italian they are more likely to assume the stress pattern to be penultimate.



For the similar antepenultimate model, greater target looks for English LexTALE may indicate a bilingual advantage in first language recognition for those that have higher English abilities. That is, due to experience with English is helpful in antepenultimate word recognition due to higher frequency of first syllable stress in English \cite{cutler2007dutch}.  That is, those with greater English skills are co-activating English lexical words when they hear primary stress on the first syllable. Like the penultimate model, duration sensitivity again shows a negative effect with target looks for antepenultimate words. Lastly, the benefit of pitch discrimination ability may be due to the fact that antepenultimate first syllables are generally higher than their penultimate counterparts. 

\subsubsection{Cue integration - individual differences}
Our investigation into cue integration revealed nuanced effects of individual differences on acoustic cue integration across fixation patterns for both antepenultimate and penultimate words. Here, we discuss the results of the four cue integration individual difference analyses. We start with our first syllable penultimate stress model and continue to the first syllable antepenultimate model, ending with their second syllable counterparts.

Like \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s penultimate acoustic cue model, our individual difference analysis revealed no significant effects within the first syllable of penultimate words. However, The simple cue integration model without individual difference during the replication analysis found interactions between speech cues - the lack of effect here underscores the importance of accounting for individual difference across word cues.

For the antepenultimate first syllable model, pitch d' and English LexTALE all had positive relationships with target fixations; suggesting, again, a bilingual advantage that transfers from English experience to the first language as well as a benefit for those with greater pitch sensitivity. The negative significant effect of duration and interactions (between duration d' and word duration and between spectral tilt and risetime) are likely due to the fact that antepenultimate first syllables more often have longer duration or higher amplitude than second syllables. That is, participants are confusing antepultimate words for penultimate counterparts if cues align with penultimate patterns. These results go against the assumption that penultiamte words are the assumed stress pattern for Italian words.

In the penultimate second syllable individual difference model, positive effect of LextITA again supports a bilingual advantage in the process of word recognition. While the high LexTALE scores lead to more looks for in English-like stress word (antepenultimate), LexITA scores, here, predict more target fixation on the more common Italian stress pattern. Again, Duration sensitivity has a negative effect on target fixations in the second syllable, this indicates that those that use duration well may confuse words that are using pitch as an indicator of stress rather than duration. This is supported also by the fact that, in contrast, those that have high formant discrimination abilities look more toward targets when the duration is longer, which could be due to there being more formant information available (i.e., longer vowels). This finding suggests variant strategies in the process of word recognition across stress in Italian lexical processing. Our findings, here, suggest that Italian listeners may not segment at the penultimate first syllable because it does not present as a strong syllable requiring acoustic validation \cite{CutlerNorris1988}. This aligns with the observation that penultimate stress patterns in Italian are recognized by default, without the need for additional acoustic cues \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}. 

Lastly, the antepenultimate second syllable individual difference model found a negative effect on the interaction between English LexTALE and pitch, here, again supports a model of word recognition that integrates across the bilingual lexicon. It seems that for those that have more English experience, English stress cues like pitch could have a greater effect. While pitch is also a predictor of stress in Italian, it may be that the participants are simply expecting a greater amount of first syllable stressed words due to their higher English proficiency.

In sum, the use of acoustic cues in Italian stress perception is variable across individuals. While our acoustic and target-competitor fixation patterns were nearly identical to \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}, our cue integration analyses revealed variant results. It seems that Italian listeners may use multiple cues simultaneously to decide if a word has penultimate or antepenultimate stress. Specifically, duration is useful in the second syllable of penultimate words. However, pitch seems like a primary cue for antepenultimate words during the first syllable. More generally, it appears that rather than assuming penultimate stress that cues during the "strong" syllable are used regardless of which stress a word has. That is, for penultimate words, second syllable cues inform prediction. However, for antepenultimate words, first syllable cues inform prediction. 

Additionally, our individual difference measures showed that language knowledge has a similar effect on prediction. Where English knowledge improves English-like stress processing and Italian knowledge improves the more common Italian stress processing. Unlike many recent studies on prediction and word recognition which examine working memory or AQ, we did not find either measure to be predictive of word recognition. This may be due to the fact that we also took into account acoustic cue sensitivity, which may have allowed us to account for any possible differences between those with ASD and neurotypical that would have appeared to be present had more basic cognitive measures like language word knowledge and acoustic cue sensitivity \cite{grossman2023}. In terms of acoustic cue sensitivity pitch sensitivity was more helpful in recognizing antepenultimate words during the first syllable, while duration was the most important sensitivity for penultimate words.

%Finally, The application of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) and random forest models provided further insights, confirming the significance of pitch and duration in predicting target fixations to stress patterns across both syllables. These machine learning approaches reinforced our parametric findings and demonstrated the robustness of our analytical framework. Our study contributes to the growing body of literature on individual differences in language processing by demonstrating how lexical proficiency and auditory processing skills modulate the integration of lexical stress cues. Unlike prior research, working memory did not come up significant in the parametric models. However, our k-NN and random forest analysis indicate that working memory is an important modulator during word recognition. Similarly, ASDQ scores also showed up as an important variable in these models. These results indicate a need for examining non-linear relationships between individual differences and cues during word recognition in order to fully understand how cognitive abilities affect the time course of lexical processing. The lack of findings for working memory in parametric models could also be due to the fact that we are looking at low frequency words at the level of word recognition rather than sentence processing. These findings have important implications for models of spoken word recognition, suggesting that cognitive and linguistic factors play a central role in word recognition and that various strategies are employed by different listeners for each word.

Future studies should explore a wider range of individual difference measures and employ longitudinal designs to assess how these factors interact over time. Additionally, examining other languages and specialized populations may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the universality and specificity of these effects. Additionally exploring how continuum-manipulated speech contrasts affect Italian word recognition would provide additional insight into the exact cues that are most useful for word recognition.
