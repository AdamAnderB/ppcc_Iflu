In conclusion, our replication and extension of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} underscore how individuals differ in their lexical stress processing and prediction. By integrating a more heterogeneous sample, we provide evidence that cognitive and linguistic factors can modulate the time course of spoken word recognition and the integration of multiple prosodic cues. Thus, the processing and prediction of Italian lexical stress involves the integration of variable cues over time while also relying on abstract knowledge about likely stress patterns.
