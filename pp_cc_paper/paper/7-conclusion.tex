In conclusion, our replication and extension of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012}'s Experiment 1 underscore how individuals differ in their lexical stress processing and prediction. By integrating a more heterogeneous sample, we provide evidence that auditory sensitivity and linguistic factors can modulate the time course of spoken word recognition and the integration of multiple prosodic cues in lexical stress processing.
