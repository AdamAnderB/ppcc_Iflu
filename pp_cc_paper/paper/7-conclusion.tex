In conclusion, our replication and extension of \cite{Sulpizio_McQueen_2012} underscore the critical role of individual differences in lexical stress processing. By integrating a more heterogeneous sample, we provide robust evidence that cognitive and linguistic factors significantly influence word recognition within the second syllable for penultimate words and for both the first and second syllable of antepenultimate words. These insights pave the way for future research to further unravel the complexities of spoken language processing and the role of individual differences across complex acoustic features.
